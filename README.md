## Installation

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd LearnSphere_CE
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the extension**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Load in Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `dist` folder from this project

### Production Installation

1. Download the latest release from the releases page
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Follow steps 4-6 from the development setup above

## Framework Setup (Task 16)

This repo is already configured with Manifest V3, TypeScript, React and webpack.

- Manifest: `src/manifest.json` (MV3 service worker background, permissions: `activeTab`, `storage`, `contextMenus`, `scripting`; host permissions for http/https)
- Bundling: `webpack.config.js` produces single-file entry points for `popup`, `content`, `background`, and `options` (no runtime chunk to avoid MV3 chunk-load issues)
- TypeScript: `tsconfig.json` targets ES2020/DOM; excludes tests from bundling outputs
- Popup/Options: React apps under `src/pages/popup` and `src/pages/options`
- Background: context menus and content script injection (`src/background/index.ts`)
- Content script: sidebar UI and multimodal chat (`src/content/index.ts`)

### Build and Load

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. Load `dist/` via `chrome://extensions` → Developer Mode → Load unpacked

### Sanity Checks

- Popup renders: click the extension icon → UI appears
- Background active: `chrome://extensions` → Service Worker → check console logs
- Context menus: right‑click a page → “🚀 LearnSphere” menu
- Content script: invoke a menu → sidebar opens

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Open a PDF**: Navigate to any PDF file in Chrome
2. **Select Content**: 
   - Highlight text to ask questions about it
   - Hold Alt and drag to select areas (diagrams, charts, etc.)
3. **Ask Questions**: Click "Ask LearnSphere" to open the chat sidebar
4. **Generate Study Aids**: Use the extension popup to create summaries and quizzes

### Features Overview

#### Text Selection
- Simply highlight any text in the PDF
- A "Ask LearnSphere" prompt will appear
- Click to open the chat with the selected text as context

#### Area Selection
- Hold the Alt key and drag to create a selection box

- Get explanations, clarifications, and additional context
- All responses are grounded in the PDF content only

#### Study Aids
- **Summaries**: Generate brief or detailed summaries of pages, chapters, or entire documents
- **Quizzes**: Create multiple-choice questions with plausible distractors
- **Flashcards**: Generate term-definition pairs for key concepts

#### Learning Dashboard
- View your learning progress and statistics
- Identify knowledge gaps and weak areas
- Get personalized revision recommendations
